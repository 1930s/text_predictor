NEURAL NET
sun -> basketball
rain -> book

RECCURENT NEURAL NET
every other day, diffetent activity
basketball -> book -> basketball -> book


Idea
Given a large dataset of cracked passwords
Learn the patterns and come up with the new passwords

1. Prepare set of unique and unsorted passwords
2. Divide into training and testing set (maybe cross-validation later)
3. Train with RNN
4. Test
5. Visualize results
